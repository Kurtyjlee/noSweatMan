# Installation Process

Ensure that you [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) are installed.

This is an expo build and it contains an expo file called expo-av.
If the app refuses to build after

```bash
npm install
```

try:

```bash
expo install expo-av
```

You may refer to [expo-av NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expo-av).

# Start the App

You may run the Android App Bundle (.aap) file or this github. If you decide to use this github directory, you may open the app using

```bash
expo start
```

Select the Platform choice and the app will appear on the emulator/device.

## Tested Devices

We ran using Expo Go:

- Samsung S20 FE 5G
- IPhone 12
- Google Pixel 4A (Android Studio Emulator)

This App is just a **Proof Of Concept**. There are **ZERO** Back-Ends (eg. AWS, Firebase) attached to this app, so whatever data you uploaded (eg. pushup scores, IPPT appointments) will not be saved. The data you have seen in the Leaderboard and History are dummy data.
